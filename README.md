# discount-for-student-dev [![Awesome](https://cdn.rawgit.com/sindresorhus/awesome/d7305f38d29fed78fa85652e3a63e154dd8e8829/media/badge.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome)
This is list of discounts on software (SaaS, PaaS, IaaS, etc.) and other offerings for developers who happen to be students.
This list is greatly inspired by the [free-for-dev list](https://github.com/ripienaar/free-for-dev).

You can help by sending Pull Requests to add more services. Please read the [contribution guidelines](contributing.md) first.
Once I have a good set of links in this README file, I'll look into a better layout for the information and links (help with that is appreciated too).

If you're not inclined to make PRs you can tweet me at [@acho_arnold](https://twitter.com/acho_arnold)!
